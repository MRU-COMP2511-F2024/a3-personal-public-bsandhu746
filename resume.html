        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <div class="content-card">
            <p>At Mount Royal University, I've explored various fields through my coursework. I've taken foundational accounting classes, which introduced me to how important it is in the world and to businesses, as well as management and human resources classes that provided insight into organizational structures, leadership styles, and employee relations. My international business coursework gave me a global perspective on cross-cultural communication and international trade. All of this has given me a much better understanding of the world and how much I didn't and still don't know.</p>
            <p>In computer science, I've completed an Introduction to Python course, where I gained problem-solving skills and programming fundamentals. I also took an entry-level Java course, learning object-oriented programming, JavaFX, and basic algorithms. I am also in an entry-level web development class, where I've learned HTML, CSS, responsive design, and accessibility principles, further enhancing my technical skills.</p>

            <p>Since November 2022, I have worked part-time as a Retail Associate at a shoe store. My responsibilities include assisting customers in finding the right footwear, maintaining a clean and organized sales floor, and handling transactions. This role has helped me develop strong social skills through daily customer interactions, as well as the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. Collaborating with colleagues to meet sales goals has also improved my teamwork, communication, and relationship skills.</p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <div class="content-card">
            <p>My academic journey and work experience have allowed me to build a diverse skill set that blends academic knowledge with real-life application. Taking courses in accounting, management, and international business has provided me with a broad perspective on different fields and has exposed me to the vast world of business. My retail experience has taught me the importance of interpersonal skills and problem-solving in real-world settings. Looking ahead, I plan to expand my technical expertise, especially in web development and programming, while exploring new opportunities to use my skills in professional environments as much as I can.</p>
