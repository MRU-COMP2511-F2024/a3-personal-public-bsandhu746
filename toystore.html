            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Object-Oriented Principles:</strong> The project uses inheritance effectively, with a parent Toy class and its respective child classes (Figures, Animals, Puzzles, BoardGames). 
                Encapsulation and polymorphism were used to ensure working and maintainable code.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>File I/O for Data Persistence:</strong> File I/O for Data Persistence: The choice to use a text file (toys.txt) ensures simplicity. 
                Error handling was implemented to manage malformed data in the form of separate files.
            </p>
            <h3>Technology Choices</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Java:</strong>Selected Java as it was for a class project, but it also has collection classes for efficient inventory management which were very helpful in the making of this project.
                <strong>Custom Exceptions:</strong> Implemented to validate user input and handle errors effectively, ensuring a smooth user experience without breaking.

        <h2>Reflections on Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <div class="content-card">
            <p>
                While developing this project, I faced memorable challenges: Handling malformed data in toys.txt. 
                This was fixed by adding validation checks and try-catch blocks to ensure errors wouldn't occur. The next Challenge was enforcing unique serial numbers. 
                Solving this required me to Implement a toyExists method with validation logic so the serial numbers wouldn't be repeated. Another challenge I faced was user input validation. 
                To solve this problem exception handling and input validation methods were implemented.

        <h2>Key Learnings and Reflections</h2>
        <div class="content-card">
            <p>
                Overall this project has helped me learn a lot more about Java and how to use it more effectively such as learning to handle text files effectively for creating a database that was able to be searched and have items removed, added, and purchased, then saving changes back to the file.
                Improving understanding of inheritance and abstraction, and how they can be used to make sub-classes. 
                Lastly, enhance skills in managing runtime exceptions for better user experience and having input validation to handle user errors as well
