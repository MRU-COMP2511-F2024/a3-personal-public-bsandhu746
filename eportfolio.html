        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This ePortfolio project is a way for me to show my web development skills and knowledge gained in COMP 2511. 
            It showcases my ability to create a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing website. This project includes 
            a homepage, project showcases, and a contact form to highlight the different elements used and design choices.

                    Developing this ePortfolio was a fun experience as it required me to balance creativity with functionality. 
                    One of the significant challenges was ensuring the site remained responsive and accessible across devices and didn't break. 
                    I experimented with CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts and adhered to WCAG guidelines for accessibility which presented challenges in itself. 
                    Refining the interactive elements, such as the contact form, and other elements showed me once again how important attention to detail is and keeping patience when dealing with problems.

                <p>
                    The project was built using HTML and a external CSS style sheet for consistent theming. 
                    Techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid ensured the layout was both responsive and visually engaging and would be good on different devices.
                    Accessibility was a key focus, incorporating alt attributes for images, semantic HTML, and appropriate 
                    labels for forms.
