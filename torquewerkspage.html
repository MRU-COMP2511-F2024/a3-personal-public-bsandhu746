                <p>
                    TorqueWerks is a fictional car manufacturer website created as part of a collaborative web development project. 
                    It features three car models—The Apex, The 9X, and The Striker—with individual pages providing photos and descriptions. 
                    Users can also fill out a form to request a test drive, demonstrating interactive functionality.

                                The making of this website was very valuable in teaching about collaborating with another individual successfully to bring a website to life. While making the website, one of the biggest challenges during this project was ensuring the website was both accessible and responsive. We worked hard to ensure the site functioned smoothly across various devices, screen sizes, and zoom levels. This required using techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox, which helped us create adaptive layouts. We also used alt attributes, proper HTML elements, and labeling to improve accessibility. Working together with my partner was a great way to think of new ideas for designs and solutions to different problems in the code, such as ensuring the test drive form validated correctly and displayed user-friendly error messages. Debugging this feature taught me the value of breaking problems down into smaller, manageable parts and how patience goes a long way when working through problems.

                                Made with HTML and styled with a separate CSS Stylesheet to set up images how we wanted to, colors we wanted, and overall design we wanted. Implemented form validation as well for booking test drives. Used techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox, which helped us create adaptive layouts. We also used alt attributes, proper HTML elements, and labeling to improve accessibility.
